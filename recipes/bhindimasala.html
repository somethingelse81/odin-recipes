    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams fresh okra (bhindi), washed, dried, and cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>2 medium-sized onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium-sized tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust according to your spice preference)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon asafoetida (hing)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the okra (bhindi) under running water and pat them dry using a clean kitchen towel. Trim off the ends and cut them into small pieces. Ensure that the okra is completely dry; otherwise, it can become slimy during cooking.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large, non-stick pan or kadai over medium heat. Add the chopped okra and sauté them for about 6-8 minutes until they are partially cooked and tender. Remove the okra from the pan and set them aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the cumin seeds and mustard seeds and let them splutter. Then, add the asafoetida (hing) and sauté for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the finely chopped onions and green chilies to the pan. Sauté them until the onions turn translucent and slightly golden brown.</li>
        <li>Stir in the ginger paste and garlic paste. Cook for a minute until the raw smell of the ginger and garlic disappears.</li>
        <li>Add the finely chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook until they become soft and mushy.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and salt. Mix well and cook the masala on low heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Once the masala is cooked and the oil starts to separate from it, add the partially cooked okra to the pan. Mix everything together gently, ensuring that the masala coats the okra evenly.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan with a lid and let the okra cook in the masala for about 5-7 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally. This will allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the garam masala and mix well. Cook for another minute, and then turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Garnish the Gujarati Bhindi Masala with freshly chopped coriander leaves.</li>
    </ol>
