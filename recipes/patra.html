    <img src="../images/patra.webp" alt="Patra">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Patra, also known as Alu Vadi or Patrode, is a popular Gujarati dish made with colocasia (taro) leaves stuffed with a spiced gram flour paste, rolled, steamed, and then sliced. Here's a traditional recipe for making Patra:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Patra rolls:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10-12 colocasia (taro) leaves (cleaned and stems removed)</li>
        <li>1 cup gram flour (besan)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tamarind pulp</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon jaggery (grated)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>A pinch of asafoetida (hing)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Tempering (Tadka):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
        <li>A pinch of asafoetida (hing)</li>
        <li>8-10 curry leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the colocasia (taro) leaves thoroughly, pat them dry, and trim the stems using a knife. Be careful as the leaves may have tiny thorns on the edges.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine gram flour, tamarind pulp, grated jaggery, turmeric powder, red chili powder, ginger paste, garlic paste, sesame seeds, cumin seeds, asafoetida, and salt. Mix well to form a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Lay one leaf flat on a clean, dry surface, with the shiny side facing down and the stem end towards you. Using your fingers or a spoon, spread a thin layer of the gram flour paste on the leaf, covering it evenly.</li>
        <li>Place another leaf on top of the first leaf, slightly overlapping. Repeat the process of applying the gram flour paste. Continue this process with 3-4 leaves until you have a layered stack.</li>
        <li>Gently and tightly roll the stacked leaves from the stem end to the tip, forming a cylindrical shape.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 3 to 5 with the remaining leaves and the gram flour paste to make more rolls.</li>
        <li>Steam the prepared rolls in a steamer for about 25-30 minutes or until the gram flour paste is cooked and the leaves are tender. You can check the doneness by inserting a knife; it should come out clean.</li>
        <li>Once the Patra rolls are steamed, allow them to cool for a few minutes, then carefully slice them into round pieces of about 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>For the tempering (tadka), heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Then, add sesame seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves. Stir-fry for a few seconds until the seeds crackle and the curry leaves turn crispy.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced Patra pieces to the tempering and saut√© gently for a couple of minutes until the pieces are lightly browned and crispy.</li>
        <li>Serve hot Patra slices as a delicious and nutritious snack or a side dish with green chutney.</li>
    </ol>
